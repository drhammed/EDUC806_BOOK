However, anyone interested in using R (or Python) should feel free to do so (and I’m happy to chat about that). If you’re generally interested in using R for statistical analysis and would like a quick intro, please refer to this website R Workshop for Statistical Analysis.\nIn fact, this website was built entirely using R!"
