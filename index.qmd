# Chapter 4- Regression

### Simple Linear Regression (SLR)

During Tutorial 2 & 3 ("Model Terminology"), I explained that Linear model and Linear regression are just synonyms and we often use either terms when quantifying the effect of a \"**continuous\"** independent variable on a\"**continuous\"** dependent (response) variable. The difference between this and ANOVA is that **ANOVA** is usually used when quantifying the effect of a \"**discrete (or categorical)\"** independent variable on a\"**continuous\"** dependent variable. So, it is important to note that- *ANOVA is also a linear regression!* In fact, if you run \"anova\" function on linear model object, you\'ll most likely get the same p-value.

**Regression** generally refers to the fact that we are quantifying the relationship between a response variable and (one or more) predictor variables. In the case of **SLR**, both the response and the predictor are *numeric* variables and we are using a single predictor (independent) variable. Later we will use multiple predictor variables (multiple regression). Also, this models tells us that our model for Y is a linear combination of the predictors X. (In this case just one predictor)! For now, this always results in a model that is a line, but this is not always the case (and we may see this later on in the semester).

Like ANOVA, in SLR, we often talk about the assumptions that this model makes. This include-

1.  Linearity- the relationship between Y and x is linear, of the form $\beta_0 + \beta_1x$.
2.  Independent. The errors $\epsilon$ are independent.
3.  Normality. The errors, $\epsilon$ are normally distributed. I.e. the \"error\" around the line follows a normal distribution.
4.  Equality of Variance. At each value of x, the variance of Y is the same.

For this lab, we will be using a year dataset on Corvettes sales in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Using this data, ten Corvettes (between 1 and 6yrs old) were randomly selected and the below data shows the sales price (in hundreds of dollars) denoted by y and the age (in years) denoted by x.

Tasks

1.  Graph the data in a scatterplot to determine if there is a possible linear relationship.
2.  Compute and interpret the linear correlation coefficient, r.
3.  Determine the regression equation for the data.
4.  Graph the regression equation and the data points.
5.  Identify outliers and potential influential observations.
6.  Compute and interpret the coefficient of determination, r2.
7.  Obtain the residuals and create a residual plot. Decide whether it is reasonable to consider that the assumptions for regression analysis are met by the variables in questions.
8.  At the 5% significance level, do the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the slope of the population regression line is not 0 and, hence, that age is useful as a predictor of sales price for Corvettes?
9.  Obtain and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the slope, Î², of the population regression line that relates age to sales price for Corvettes.
10. Obtain a point estimate for the mean sales price of all 4-year-old Corvettes.
11. Determine a 95% confidence interval for the mean sales price of all 4-year-old Corvettes.
12. Find the predicted sales price of Jack Smith\'s 4-year-old Corvette.
13. Determine a 95% prediction interval for the sales price of Jack Smith\'s 4-year-old Corvette.

To begin, open your SPSS and enter the two variables in the SPSS frame.
